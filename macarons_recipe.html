<h1>~Macarons~</h1>

<font face="Papyrus" color="magenta">

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<p>1 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar </p>
<p>1 cup almond flour</p>
<p>3 large egg whites, at room temperature</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</p>
<p>Pinch of salt</p>
<p>1/4 cup superfine sugar</p>
<p>2 to 3 drops gel food coloring</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon vanilla, almond or mint extract</p>
<p>Assorted fillings (see below)</p>

<strong><h2>Special Ingredients:</h2></strong>
<p>Oven with convection setting</p>
<p>4 baking sheets</p>
<p>3 silicone baking mats</p>
<p>Fine-mesh sieve</p>
<p>Pastry bag with 1/4-inch round tip</p>


<strong><h2>Directions:</h2></strong>
<p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F using the convection setting. Line 3 baking sheets with silicone mats. Measure the confectioners' sugar and almond flour by spooning them into measuring cups and leveling with a knife. Transfer to a bowl; whisk to combine.</p>
<p>Sift the sugar-almond flour mixture, a little at a time, through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing with a rubber spatula to pass through as much as possible. It will take a while, and up to 2 tablespoons of coarse almond flour may be left; just toss it.</p>
<p>Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt with a mixer on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to medium high; gradually add the superfine sugar and beat until stiff and shiny, about 5 more minutes.</p>
<p>Transfer the beaten egg whites to the bowl with the almond flour mixture. Draw a rubber spatula halfway through the mixture and fold until incorporated, giving the bowl a quarter turn with each fold.</p>
<p>Add the food coloring and extract (see below). Continue folding and turning, scraping down the bowl, until the batter is smooth and falls off the spatula in a thin flat ribbon, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Holding the bag vertically and close to the baking sheet, pipe 1 1/4-inch circles (24 per sheet). Firmly tap the baking sheets twice against the counter to release any air bubbles.</p>
<p>Let the cookies sit at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky to the touch, 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the humidity. Slip another baking sheet under the first batch (a double baking sheet protects the cookies from the heat).</p>
<p>Bake the first batch until the cookies are shiny and rise 1/8 inch to form a "foot," about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat, using a double sheet for each batch. Peel the cookies off the mats and sandwich with a thin layer of filling (see below).</p>

<strong><h2>Assorted Fillings:</h2></strong>
<h2>~Almond-Raspberry~</h2>
<p>Tint the batter with 2 drops neon pink gel food coloring; flavor with almond extract. Fill with seedless raspberry jam (you'll need about 3/4 cup).</p>

<strong><h2>~Mint-White Chocolate~</h2></strong>
