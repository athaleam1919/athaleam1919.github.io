<p>7.Spread about 1 tablespoon of the mascarpone and vanilla mixture in the center of each of the puff pastry strips. Layer the top half with the peach slices overlapping each other and the tops hanging out of the puff pastry.</p>
<p>8.At this point you can also add a very thin layer of the peach preserves mixed with the lemon juice. Totally optional. If you do use it, make sure to only use a very thin layer.</p>
<p>9.Fold the bottom half of the puff pastry over the peaches and mascarpone, then gently roll it up into a rose starting from the left.</p>
<p>10.Repeat with the remaining peaches and puff pastry strips and place them inside a large silicone muffin tin or large muffin silicone cups.</p>
<p>11.Place in the preheated oven and bake for about 45 minutes or so, just until the puff pastry is puffed up and cooked through.</p>
<p>12.Transfer to a cooling rack and drizzle with the honey all over the top.</p>
<p>13.Allow the peach roses to cool off before removing them from muffin tin or silicone cups.</p>
<p>14.Garnish with the powder sugar and flower blossoms and enjoy!</p>
